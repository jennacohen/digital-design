### [Printing Hate Investigation](https://lynching.cnsmaryland.org/)

Printing Hate is an investigation into how white-owned newspapers have aided and abetted lynchings since 1865.

Our design also included several story page layouts and an interactive database.

### [New York’s illegal weed market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVTz3qN1KaM)

I produced original assets, graphics and animations to tell the story of New York’s illegal weed market visually.

In 2022, one out of 10 South Dakotans didn’t have health insurance, according to the Census Bureau.
